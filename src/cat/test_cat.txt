Sotha Sil watched as the novices swam one by one to the oassom tree, 
plucking fruit or flower from its tall branches before falling to the ground with varying degrees of grace. 
He seized the moment and shook his head approvingly, admiring the day. 
The whitewashed statue of Siraban , 
for which the great magician himself was rumored to have posed in time immemorial,
